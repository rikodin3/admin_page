                <br><br>
                Maybe someday, I'll get to say it<br>
                Maybe someday, you'll notice it<br>
                Through my excited eyes, visibly lit<br>
                Words at the surface, ready to admit<br><br>

                जो लफ्ज़ न बयां पाए, आँखें ने सुना दी<br>
                कहें भी तो क्या कहें, बातें भीतर फंस गई<br>
                खयाल करें, क्या लेना देना तकदीर से,<br>
                जब दिल किसी की भी बात सुनता नहीं<br><br>

                Why, the reflexes differ from her<br>
                One touch and the universe halts<br>
                Step by step, our worlds get closer<br>
                Yet miles apart from the you she wants<br><br>

                You were never mine to keep<br>
                Only a vision for my eyes to see<br>
                Day in and day out, the urge to speak<br>
                Look at me once, and my knees go weak<br><br>

                Hold me close like you held no other,<br>
                But tear me to fine shreds inside<br>
                One look, and my self control wavers<br>
                A new world formed, the former tossed aside<br><br>

                Craved to be a dream of yours<br>
                But she took the one and only spot<br>
                Jealousy? It's way more than that<br>
                Stood no chance, in solitude I sat<br><br>

                The breeze carries her pined longing<br>
                Carrying secrets no one's ever known<br>
                Hoping his heart listens to her calling<br>
                Her impatience leaving her mind torn<br><br>

                Feels like he's so close, but yet so far<br>
                She's blinded by her short-term scar<br>
                One step away, but million steps within<br>
                That one insecurity etched along her skin<br><br>

                She's so obsessed, it kills her deep down<br>
                A day without him, she trips into the unknown<br>
                Bodily brine painting her soft, pretty face<br>
                Longing for his unattainable embrace<br><br>

                Wanting to erase her survival need<br>
                She's confused if he's taken her lead<br>
                If maybe, when dusk becomes dawn<br>
                A keen, pining need for her is born<br><br>

                The you she yearns for, the you she craves for<br>
                The you with whom she can never soar<br>
                Dancing along this thin, invisible line<br>
                Awaiting for her beloved deva to decline<br>
                Before she surrenders by her own will,<br>
                She needed him to willingly freeze her still<br><br>❤️
